# JS Monad

Inspired by a great video [What is a Monad? - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1e8gqXLbsU),
try to use TypeScript to show the same example to demonstrate what's the problem Monad can help and how it solves the problem.
Hopefully this example could help you understand what Monad is.
